# ai-lofi
AI-generated LoFi by Hannes Salzmann and Manuel Ineichen

This project is an AI-generated hommage to the musical genre of LoFi. On this website, the user is invited to "relax" to soothing LoFi-beats, produced by an audio Diffusion model.

For the visuals, we used RunwayML's Gen-1 video diffusion model to generate a futuristic version of the iconic Study Girl animation. The original video can be seen [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jfKfPfyJRdk).

This project was made during the module COMPP by Guillaume Massol at Lucern University of Applied Sciences and Arts.

## The Model
We used HarmonAI's Dance Diffusion model, specifically the pretrained checkpoint "jmann-small-190k".

## The Notebooks
There are two colab notebooks by HarmonAI for their Diffusion model, one to generate audio, and another one to finetune their models.

To generate audio: [![Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/github/Harmonai-org/sample-generator/blob/main/Dance_Diffusion.ipynb)

## The Dataset
We worked with two different datasets in the course of our project:

For the first run, we used this playlist on youtube:
